# Automating Terraform with GitHub Actions

[![terraform-automation](https://github.com/r4rohan/terraform-with-cicd/actions/workflows/terraform.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/r4rohan/terraform-with-cicd/actions/workflows/terraform.yml)

This repo is a part of Medium Article. <br>
Follow Medium blog for steps: [Automating Terraform with GitHub Actions](https://rohankalhans.medium.com/automating-terraform-with-github-actions-5b3aac5abea7)

**Main Points**
* GCS bucket is serving as terraform backend.

* Workflow offers concurrency which means only one workflow can be run at a time; Iâ€™ve done this to prevent our terraform state from locking and getting corrupted.

* GitHub secrets are being used to pass GCP Service Account credentials safely on runtime.

* Terraform Plan generates a plan file which is further used by terraform apply. This is done to prevent uninformed changes b/w plan and apply.

* Terraform code must be properly formatted which is considered a good practice else terraform format validation will throw an error and the pipeline would get stopped.

* Manual Approval before applying terraform apply stage.

* Slack Integration for Workflow Alerts.





How can you use GitHub Actions?
Follow to this steps:

* Go to the variables.tf and change project id to your GCP project id

* Go to the secrets under repo and add your GCP Credentials by using the name GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS

* Go to the settings and under Environment add 'apply_to_prod' , select checkbox 
'Required reviewers' and there add the github names of users(who can approve to this project)

* Open the file 'main.tf' and specify GCS Bucket under backend(in order to save tfstate files in bucket)

* Go to the Actions and run workflow mannually by clicking the buttom 'run workflow'

* If the job 'Terraform plan' was run successfully then it will ask you apporval 

* If you want to destroy infrastructure , you should open config.yaml and at the end of the file uncomment 'terraform destory' and run workflow again

# Adding CircleCI Beknazar

> I have added Circleci for this project with the same logic as Nurmukhammed does.
1. Adding credentials to the Circleci Context and take it from there.(this was Beki's GCP creds )

        
1. Creating Google storage for **.tfstate** file to safe our spin up info about terraform file

        terraform {
            backend "gcs" {
              bucket = "beki-my-bucket-for-circleci"
              prefix = "terraform/state"
            }  
1. In circleci we have to put context after workflow and than it will work.
        
        workflows: 
          build:
            jobs:
              - build:
                  context: GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS 
              - Attention When you will approve:
                  type: approval 
                  requires:
                    - build
              - build2:
                  context: GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS
                  requires: 
                    - Attention When you will approve.
                    - build
# Adding destroy part to the circleci
>1. Firstly we have to plan our **mian.tf** to know what kind of actions it will do. Job to plan this in CircleCI
        
        plan_to_deploy:
          working_directory: /terraform/state
          docker: 
            - image: hashicorp/terraform  
          steps:
            - checkout 
            - run:
                name: "init"
                command: terraform init
            - run:
                name: "plan"
                command: terraform plan   -input=false 

>2. Job to **deploy** to GCP

      deploy:
        working_directory: /terraform/state
        docker: 
          - image: hashicorp/terraform  

        steps:
          - checkout 
          - run:
              name: "init"
              command: terraform init

          - run:
              name: "apply"
              command: terraform apply --auto-approve 
            
>3. Job to  **plan to destroy** 

        plan_to_destroy:
          docker:
            - image: hashicorp/terraform:latest
          working_directory: /terraform/state
          steps:
            - checkout
            - run:
                name: Init
                command: terraform init -input=false
            - run:
                name: Plan
                command: terraform plan -destroy -input=false -out=tfplan -no-color
            - run:
                name: Render plan for PR comment
                command: terraform show -no-color tfplan > tfplan.txt
            - persist_to_workspace:
                root: /terraform/state
                paths:
                  - . 
>here we have to specify working directory **working_directory: /terraform/state** and persist our **tfplan** to the root: **/terraform/state**
>4. aplly destroy file

      destroy:
        docker:
          - image: hashicorp/terraform:latest
        working_directory: /terraform/state
        steps:
          - attach_workspace:
              at: /terraform/state
          - run:
              name: destroy
              command: terraform apply tfplan


            
>5. Workflow for project

    workflows:
      version: 2
      plan_pr:
        jobs:
          - plan_to_deploy:
              context: GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS 
          
          - hold:
              type:  approval
          
          - deploy:
              context: GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS 
              requires:
                - plan_to_deploy
                - hold
          
          - plan_to_destroy:
              context: GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS
              requires:
                - deploy
          
          - approve_desroty1:
              type:  approval
              requires:
                - plan_to_destroy
          - approve_desroty2:
              type:  approval
              requires:
                - approve_desroty1
           
          
          - destroy:
              context: GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS 
              requires:
                
                - approve_desroty1
                - approve_desroty2
